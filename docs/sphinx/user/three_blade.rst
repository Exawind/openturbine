Example: Three Blade Rotor
==========================

This example will walk through how to run a simulation of a rotor made of three blades connected to a central hub.
We'll use Kynema's low level API, which, unlike Kynema's high level APIs, will require us to manually set up all nodes and their connectivities.
This extra complexity is the trade-off required for unlimited freedom.
For the most up to date and working version of this code, see ``tests/documentation_tests/three_blade_rotor/``.

As with any C++ program, start with the includes.
As a Kokkos-based library, you'll need to include ``Kokkos_Core.hpp`` for setup, teardown, and working with Kynema's data structures.
From Kynema, you'll have to include ``model.hpp`` for the Model class, our tool for setting up and creating the system, and ``step.hpp`` for the Step function which performs the action of system asembly and solve.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <array>
    #include <cassert>
    #include <Kokkos_Core.hpp>
    #include <model/model.hpp>
    #include <step/step.hpp>

We now create the main function of our program and initialize Kokkos.
We also start a scope around the rest of the program.
This scoping is necessary to ensure that all Kokkos objects are destroyed before finalize is called and the program exits.
Failure to do this will result in lots of nasty, hard to decipher errors on program termination.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int main() {
        Kokkos::initialize();
        {
            ...
        }
        Kokkos::finalize();
        return 0;
    }


Now, we will need to define our Beam Sections, which consist of the mass and stiffness matrices defined at given nodes along the beam.
These physical properties will be interpolated to the quadrature points for use in our simulation.
This problem uses a constant-cross-section blade, so the sections at the root and tip of the beam will be identical, but any number of complex cross-sections can be modeled.

.. code-block:: cpp

    constexpr auto mass_matrix = std::array{
        std::array{8.538e-2, 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 8.538e-2, 0., 0., 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 0., 8.538e-2, 0., 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 0., 0., 1.4433e-2, 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 0., 0., 0., 0.40972e-2, 0.},
        std::array{0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.0336e-2},
    };
    constexpr auto stiffness_matrix = std::array{
        std::array{1368.17e3, 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 88.56e3, 0., 0., 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 0., 38.78e3, 0., 0., 0.},
        std::array{0., 0., 0., 16.9600e3, 17.6100e3, -0.3510e3},
        std::array{0., 0., 0., 17.6100e3, 59.1200e3, -0.3700e3},
        std::array{0., 0., 0., -0.3510e3, -0.3700e3, 141.470e3},
    };
    const auto sections = std::vector{
        kynema::BeamSection(0., mass_matrix, stiffness_matrix),
        kynema::BeamSection(1., mass_matrix, stiffness_matrix),
    };

We now define the node locations where our solution will be defined.
In this case, we will use the a six node GLL basis.
Like the sections, these will be defined along the blade's reference axis.

.. code-block:: cpp

    const auto node_s = std::array{
        0., 0.11747233803526763, 0.35738424175967748, 0.64261575824032247, 0.88252766196473242, 1.
    };

As a final piece of information, we will define the quadrature points and their weights.
We've precalculated these to be a seven point GL quadrature rule, which will be sufficiently accurate for both our basis and mass/stiffness matrix distribution.

.. code-block:: cpp

    const auto quadrature = std::vector<std::array<double, 2>>{
        {-0.9491079123427585, 0.1294849661688697},  {-0.7415311855993943, 0.27970539148927664},
        {-0.40584515137739696, 0.3818300505051189}, {6.123233995736766e-17, 0.4179591836734694},
        {0.4058451513773971, 0.3818300505051189},   {0.7415311855993945, 0.27970539148927664},
        {0.9491079123427585, 0.1294849661688697},
    };

A Model is Kynema's low level interface for specifying elements, nodes, constraints, and their connectivities.
One everything has been specified, we will use model to create Kynema's fundamental data structures and advance the problem in time.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto model = kynema::Model();

The aptly named SetGravity method is used to set the gravity vector for the problem.

.. code-block:: cpp

    model.SetGravity(0., 0., -9.81);

When specifying the beam elements, we'll also set the initial velocity.
To help formulate this, we specify the rotor velocity (both translational and rotational) and the origin about which we'll rotate.

.. code-block:: cpp

    constexpr auto velocity = std::array{0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.};
    constexpr auto origin = std::array{0., 0., 0.};
    constexpr auto hub_radius = 2.;

We'll now define three beam elements to be our main rotor.  Each of these beams will be
identical, but we'll rotate each of them by 120 degrees around the origin to create a
rotor like one would see on a wind turbine.

.. code-block:: cpp

    constexpr auto num_blades = 3;
    for (auto blade_number = 0; blade_number < num_blades; ++blade_number) {
        auto beam_node_ids = std::vector<size_t>(node_s.size());
        std::transform(
            std::cbegin(node_s), std::cend(node_s), std::begin(beam_node_ids),
            [&](auto s) {
                return model.AddNode().SetElemLocation(s).SetPosition(10. * s, 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.).Build();
            }
        );
        auto blade_elem_id = model.AddBeamElement(beam_node_ids, sections, quadrature);
        auto rotation_quaternion = kynema::math::RotationVectorToQuaternion(
            {0., 0., 2. * M_PI * blade_number / num_blades}
        );
        model.TranslateBeam(blade_elem_id, {hub_radius, 0., 0.});
        model.RotateBeamAboutPoint(blade_elem_id, rotation_quaternion, origin);
        model.SetBeamVelocityAboutPoint(blade_elem_id, velocity, origin);
    }

To control the rotation of the turbine, we create a node to act as a hub and attach
the nearest node of each beam element to the hub with a rigid joint constraint.
We then create a prescribed boundary condidition constraint on the hub, which we will
modify during time stepping to create rotation.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto hub_node_id = model.AddNode().SetPosition(0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.).Build();
    for (const auto& beam_element : model.GetBeamElements()) {
        model.AddRigidJointConstraint({hub_node_id, beam_element.node_ids.front()});
    }
    auto hub_bc_id = model.AddPrescribedBC(hub_node_id);

Now that the problem has been fully described in the model, we will create Kynema's main data structures: State, Elements, Constraints, and Solver.

The CreateSystem method takes an optional template argument with a Kokkos device describing where the system will reside and run.
By default, it uses Kokkos' default execution/memory space, so a serial build will run on the CPU, a CUDA build will run on a CUDA device, etc.

The CreateSolver<> function uses the connectivity defined in the State, Elements, and Constraints structures to construct the Solver object.

State contains the current state (position, velocity, etc) information for each node.

Elements contains each a Beams, Masses, and Springs structure.
These contain the connectivity and basis information or all of the elements of the respective type.

Constraints contains the connectivity information for each constraint in the system.

Solver contains the linear system (sparse matrix, RHS) and linear system solver

.. code-block:: cpp
   
    auto [state, elements, constraints] = model.CreateSystem();
    auto solver = kynema::CreateSolver<>(state, elements, constraints);

The final stage is to create a StepParameters object, which contains information like the number of non-linear iterations, time step size, and numerical damping factor used to take a single time step.

.. code-block:: cpp

    const bool is_dynamic_solve(true);
    const int max_iter(4);
    const double step_size(0.01);
    const double rho_inf(0.9);
    const double t_end(0.1);
    const auto num_steps = static_cast<size_t>(std::floor(t_end / step_size + 1.0));
    auto parameters = kynema::StepParameters(is_dynamic_solve, max_iter, step_size, rho_inf);

Kynema allows the user to control the actual time stepping process.
This includes setting forces, post-processing data, or coupling to other codes.
For this problem, we will prescribe a rotation on the hub boundary condition, which will be transmitted to the blades through their respective constraints.

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (auto i = 0U; i < num_steps; ++i) {
        const auto q_hub = kynema::math::RotationVectorToQuaternion(
            {step_size * (i + 1) * velocity[3], step_size * (i + 1) * velocity[4],
             step_size * (i + 1) * velocity[5]}
        );
        const auto u_hub = std::array{0., 0., 0., q_hub[0], q_hub[1], q_hub[2], q_hub[3]};
        constraints.UpdateDisplacement(hub_bc_id, u_hub);
        [[maybe_unused]] const auto converged =
            kynema::Step(parameters, solver, elements, state, constraints);
        assert(converged);
    }

Walkthrough
===========

This section demonstrates a typical OpenTurbine workflow, walking through the steps
required to analyze wind turbine components and systems. The compilation instructions
outline how to build OpenTurbine and its dependencies. OpenTurbine is part of the
ExaWind software suite, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for wind energy
modeling and simulation.

.. note::

   This tutorial is intended to provide an example of how OpenTurbine is often used,
   but there are many variations and alternative workflows that OpenTurbine
   provides. Please consult the :doc:`../user/user` for additional details on
   other OpenTurbine features and options.

Overview
========

`Kynema <https://github.com/kynema/kynema>`_ 
is an open-source flexible multibody dynamics (FMD) solver designed for time-domain simulations.  While tailored for wind turbine structural dynamics, the formulation and implementation is that of a general FMD solver and can readily be applied to other systems.  Kynema was designed with a narrow focus, namely to provide a lightweight, accurate FMD solver for coupling to fluid-dynamics codes in wind turbine research, especially the `ExaWind <https://github.com/exawind>`_ [@Sprague-etal:2020,@Sharma-etal:2023,@Kuhn-etal:2025] suite of computational-fluid-dynamics codes.
Wind turbine blades and towers are long slender structures; as such turbines can be represented at high-fidelity with beams, rigid bodies, and constraints.  Kynema provides these model elements, where degrees of freedom are defined in the inertial/global frame of reference and include displacements and rotations (formally as rotation matrices, but stored as quaternions).
The underlying formulation is built on a Lie-group time integrator for index-3 differential-algebraic equations which is second-order accurate in time [@Bruls-etal:2012].
Beam models are based on geometrically exact beam theory (GEBT) and are discretized as high-order spectral finite elements similar to those in the BeamDyn module [@Wang-etal:2017] of `OpenFAST <https://github.com/openfast/>`_ [@Jonkman:2013].
The governing equations for a FMD system like a wind turbine form a highly nonlinear system of constrained partial-differential equations.  Kynema uses analytical Jacobians in the nonlinear-system solves performed at each time step.  Linear systems use sparse storage and several third-party sparse-linear-system solvers are enabled. Ill conditioning of our linear systems are mitigated with preconditioning described in [@Bottasso-etal:2008].  Kynema is integrated with a simple open-source controller [@Abbas-etal:2022].
Kynema is written in C++ and leverages Kokkos and Kokkos-Kernels as its performance portability layer enabling simulations on both CPU and GPU systems.   The repository is equipped with extensive automated testing at the unit and regression/system levels including several full reference megawatt-scale reference turbines.
Kynema fills the need for a lightweight, open-source turbine structural dynamics code that is high fidelity, robust, fast, and capable on running on different computer architectures.

Software-development objectives of Kynema
==============================================

- Kynema adheres to modern software development best practices. The
  development process emphasizes test-driven development (TDD), version control,
  hierarchical automated testing, and continuous integration, leading to a robust
  development environment.
- Kynema is being developed in modern C++ and leverages
  `Kokkos <https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos>`_ as its performance-portability
  library, drawing inspiration from the ExaWind stack.
- The core data structures are crafted to be memory efficient, enabling
  vectorization and parallelization at multiple levels.
- These structures are data-oriented to leverage accelerated computing methods,
  including high utilization of chip resources (e.g., single instruction multiple
  data, SIMD), parallelization through GPGPUs or other hardware, and support for
  memory-efficient architectures.
- The computational algorithms incorporate robust open-source libraries for
  mathematical operations, resource allocation, and data management.
- The API design considers the needs of multiple stakeholders, ensuring
  integration with existing and future ecosystems for data science, machine
  learning, and AI.

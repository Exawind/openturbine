Documentation
=============

OpenTurbine comes with two different types of documentation:

- The manual, i.e., the document you are reading now, that is
  written using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_, and

- Inline documentation within C++ source code that are written in a format that can be
  processed automatically by `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html>`_

Manual
------

The OpenTurbine manual is written using a special format called
ReStructured Text (ReST) and is converted into HTML and PDF formats
using a python package Sphinx. Since the manuals are written in simple
text files, they can be version controlled alongside the source
code. Documentation is automatically generated with new updates to the
GitHub repository and deployed at `OpenTurbine documentation site
<https://exawind.github.io/openturbine>`_.

Writing documentation
`````````````````````

As mentioned previously, documentation is written using a special text format
called reStructuredText. Sphinx user manual provides a `reST Primer
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_ that
provides an overview of this format and how to write documentation using this format.

Source code documentation
-------------------------

Source code (C++ files) are commented using a special format that
allows Doxygen to extract the annotated comments and create source
code documentation as well as inheritance diagrams. The
:doc:`../doxygen/html/index` documentation for the latest snapshot of
the codebase can be browsed in this manual. The `Doxygen manual
<http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html>`_ provides an overview of
the syntax that must be used. Please follow the Doxygen style of
commenting code when commenting OpenTurbine sources.

When commenting code, try to use self-documenting code, i.e., descriptive names
for variables and functions that eliminate the need to describe what is going on
in comments. In general, comments should address *why* something is being coded
in a particular way, rather than how the code does things. Try to write the code
in a clear manner so that it is obvious from reading the code instead of having
to rely on comments to follow the code structure.

Building documentation
----------------------

Documentation Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate the OpenTurbine documentation locally, several dependencies are required:

* ``doxygen`` - For generating source code documentation
* ``graphviz`` - For creating inheritance diagrams
* ``sphinx`` - For building the manual
* ``enchant`` - For spell checking
* ``doxysphinx`` - For integrating Doxygen with Sphinx

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~

System Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Ubuntu/Debian Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends graphviz libenchant-2-dev

For macOS using Homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install doxygen graphviz enchant

Python Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install required Python packages using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx_toolbox sphinx_copybutton pyenchant sphinxcontrib-spelling doxysphinx

Building Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd build && cmake -DOPENTURBINE_ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=ON .. && cmake --build . -t docs

.. note::

   macOS users may need to set the enchant library path:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ export PYENCHANT_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/libenchant-2.dylib

The built documentation will be available in the ``docs/sphinx/html`` directory. For other output formats,
see the `Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/builders/index.html>`_.

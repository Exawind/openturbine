 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * `OpenTurbine` is a new, open-source wind turbine structural dynamics simulation
 * code designed to meet the research needs of Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)
 * and the broader wind energy community for land-based and offshore wind turbines.
 * `OpenTurbine` will provide high-fidelity, highly performant structural dynamics
 * models that can couple with low-fidelity aerodynamic/hydrodynamic models like those
 * in [OpenFAST](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast), as well as high-fidelity
 * computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models like those in the WETO and Office
 * of Science supported [ExaWind](https://github.com/Exawind) code suite.
